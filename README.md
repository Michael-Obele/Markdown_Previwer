This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template. And yes I used [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) too.

# The Work
The site has:
- Dark Mode
- Very simple interface
- And a nice looking initial preview state (that dummy function works too)
- Other features coming too

You can see the site [here!](https://markdown-previewer-moa.netlify.app/)
